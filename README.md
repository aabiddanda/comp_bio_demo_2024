# Computational Biology Demo

Demonstration of computational biology for Skype a Scientist.

## Data 

We will be working with small-scale data from the 1000 Genomes Project. This includes LD-pruned data from 179 CEU samples and 633 samples across the EUR regional grouping on chromosome 22.

Semi-processed data in VCF format are found in `data/`. Data converted into NPZ format is found in `data/npz_files/`, after running `data/process_vcf.py`. 

## Demo
